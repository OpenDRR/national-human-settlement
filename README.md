# National Human Settlement Layers

## Overview of this Repository

This repository is used for the development of the National Human Settlement Layers (NHSL). The NHSL is a collection of datasets that describe the physical and social characteristics of communities across Canada in the context of their vulnerability to natural hazards. This information is intended to be used as baseline inputs to natural hazards risks assessments where such information is unavailable. The purpose is to support implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction at the local, regional, and national scales.

Information is currently disseminated in the Physical Exposure and Social Fabric components of the NHSL. The Physical Exposure component includes a delineation of settled areas and related land use across Canada, as well as information about buildings, persons, and building replacement values (structure and contents) within those areas. The Social Fabric component of the NHSL includes information about broad spatial patterns of social vulnerability at the neighbourhood scale, and indicators about the capacities for a community to withstand and recover from disaster events based on characteristics of housing, family structure, individual autonomy and financial agency.

The Geological Survey of Canada, through the Public Safety Geoscience Program, has developed these datasets. Please direct any questions about the NHSL layers to Philip LeSueur at philip.lesueur@canada.ca or Nicky Hastings at nicky.hastings@canada.ca.


### Available Datasets

- [Physical Exposure](https://github.com/OpenDRR/national-human-settlement/tree/main/physical-exposure)
- [Social Fabric](https://github.com/OpenDRR/national-human-settlement/tree/main/social-fabric)

## Technical Use

Physical exposure and social fabric components of the NHSL are provided as geopackages (.gkpg), which are geospatial files that can be opened with most geographic information systems (GIS). Each dataset has an accompanying data dictionary that provides a detailed summary of attributes. The information can be downloaded from the ‘data’ sub-folders within the Physical Exposure or Social Fabric directories. It is possible to download individual files from the web, by clicking on either 'Raw' or 'Download' from the top right corner of a file preview page. For those wishing to clone this repository, please ensure you have Git LFS enabled on your machine prior to cloning.
