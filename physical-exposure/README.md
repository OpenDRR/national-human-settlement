# National Human Settlement - Physical Exposure

The Physical Exposure component of the National Human Settlement Layer (NHSL) includes a delineation of settled areas and related land use across Canada, as well as information about buildings, persons, and capital value of buildings assets (structure and contents) within those areas.

This model represents an inventory of more than 9.1 million buildings in Canada; population dynamics at different times of day for 35.1 million people, and; the capital value of building assets totalling more than 8.3 trillion CAD$.

Buildings are classified according to their construction type, occupancy, and age. These classes are derived from the standard North American  HAZUS  building  taxonomy and include 38 construction classes representing different types of wood, concrete, masonry, steel and prefabricated structures; 33 occupancy classes representing a mix of residential, civic, commercial and industrial land uses; and 4 age classes representing the assumed level of building design. The distribution of resulting ‘building archetypes’ are assigned to settled areas based on associated land-use and census characteristics.

Building populations at different times of day are estimated for standard daytime hours (9am-5pm); for morning and evening commute hours when people are in transit (7am-9am; 5pm-7pm), and; for nighttime hours when the majority of people are at home (7pm-7am).

The capital value of buildings assets is provided for structural and non-structural components of the building, as well as the potential building contents. Asset values are estimated based on industry replacement costs for representative regions across Canada.
