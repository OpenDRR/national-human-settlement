# National Human Settlement - Social Vulnerability

The Social Vulnerability component of the National Human Settlement Layer (NHSL) includes information about broad spatial patterns of social vulnerability at the neighbourhood scale, and indicators about the capacities for a community to withstand and recover from disaster events based on intrinsic characteristics of housing, family structure, individual autonomy and financial agency.

The social vulnerability index and capacity threshold indicators help to identify underlying patterns of social vulnerability within a given community. The model includes six composite indicators that describe the estimated total social vulnerability, and vulnerability level that might arise due to housing conditions, family structure, individual autonomy and financial agency. The model provide a means of comparing relative levels of vulnerability from one region to another across Canada and help identify specific neighbourhoods within which capacities to withstand and recover from disaster events may be strained.
